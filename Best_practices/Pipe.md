1. Use pipe for Visual purpose only.
2. dont use it in stand alone component , because if you use it you have to make pipe stand alone and you need to import that pipe instance and it will create a new instance thats why it will also ocupy the space. and if you are not making pipe to work with standalone, it will show error. 
3. one module where we import all our data.
